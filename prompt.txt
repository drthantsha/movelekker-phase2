 Prompt: Build MoveLekker Phase 2 (No Backend)
Build a two-page HTML and JavaScript web app called MoveLekker. The app helps users find and contact moving agents across South Africa. This is Phase 2, so no backend is used, and the contact sharing is handled via EmailJS. Here's the user journey and requirements:

📍 Page 1 – index.html
Show a list of 10 hardcoded moving agents.

Each agent must have:

name

city

truck type (Bakkie, Medium Truck, or Large Truck)

profile picture (use placeholder)

Display agents in a responsive grid using plain HTML/CSS.

Each card must have a “View Details” button that links to agent.html?id=AGENT_ID.

📍 Page 2 – agent.html
Read agent ID from URL parameter and load agent info.

Show:

name

province

city

area/town

truck type

Do NOT show the phone number yet.

Below the info, display a form asking user to enter:

Their email

Their phone number

A “Reveal Contact Info” button

When the user submits:

Show the agent’s phone number immediately on the screen.

Send an email to the user (using EmailJS) with:

Agent’s name and phone number

User’s submitted email and phone

Use emailjs.init("YOUR_USER_ID") and call emailjs.send(...)
